# Primordial Black Hole Diffusion Simulations

As a research intern with the Primordial Black Holes (PBH) group at MIT, I am investigating the diffusion of particles emitted by evaporating PBHs, particularly those with masses near 10ยนโด grams expected to evaporate in the current epoch.

Under the mentorship of Alexandra Klipfel and guidance from Professors Peter Fisher and David Kaiser, I use Python to simulate particle emission and diffusion, generating visualizations of evolving density profiles and energy spectra. These simulations aim to evaluate the potential detectability of PBH evaporation signals by space-based instruments.

Beyond developing custom simulation code, I contribute to the group's shared diffusion framework by producing plots and tools to analyze particle propagation across various energy, spatial, and temporal scales. This work supports broader efforts to identify observational signatures of PBHs and investigate their viability as dark matter candidates.
